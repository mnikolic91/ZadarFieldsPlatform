# Zadar Fields Project - 2021

Welcome to the Zadar Fields Project, a dedicated platform designed to serve as a comprehensive database of local family farms (OPGs) and promote the agriculture of our region. This initiative is aimed at leveraging technology to support and enhance the visibility of local agriculture, connecting consumers directly with producers.

## Key Features

- **Database Collection**: At its core, the platform gathers detailed information about local family farms through our user-friendly WTF-Flask form. This data is then stored in our Firestore database, ensuring easy access and management.

- **Promotion of Local Producers**: Beyond data collection, our platform acts as a promotional tool, showcasing local producers to consumers and service users. With an integrated Google Maps interface, users can effortlessly locate and learn about family farms in their vicinity.

- **Newsletter Subscription**: Users can subscribe to our newsletter to receive regular updates from the green fields of our region. This feature keeps our community informed about the vegetable season, introduces new farms seeking market presence, and shares relevant agricultural news.

- **Marketplace Opportunity**: By bridging the gap between consumers and local producers, we foster a marketplace where authentic, locally-produced goods are easily accessible, supporting the local economy and sustainable agriculture practices.
- **Educational Blog**: Our platform features a blog that provides valuable insights, stories, and educational content about sustainable farming practices, local agriculture trends, and the challenges and successes of our community's family farms. The blog is a resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of local agriculture and its importance to our community.
